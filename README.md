# Python Voice Recorder with GUI üéôÔ∏è

## Overview
This is a desktop voice recorder application built with Python. It uses `tkinter` for the graphical interface, `sounddevice` and `scipy` for audio recording and playback, and `matplotlib` for real-time waveform visualization. This project demonstrates audio processing, real-time feedback, and basic GUI development in Python.

## Features
- **Audio Recording**: Record audio in high-quality `.wav` format.
- **Waveform Visualization**: See real-time waveform display during recording.
- **Playback and Save**: Playback recorded audio, and save it to your system.
- **Recording Timer**: Track the duration of the recording in real-time.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **tkinter**: For building the GUI.
- **sounddevice**: For audio recording.
- **scipy**: For saving `.wav` files.
- **matplotlib**: For real-time waveform visualization.

## How to Use
1. **Record**: Click "Record" to start recording audio.
2. **Stop**: Click "Stop" to finish recording.
3. **Play**: Click "Play" to listen to your recording.
4. **Save**: Click "Save" to save the recording as a `.wav` file.

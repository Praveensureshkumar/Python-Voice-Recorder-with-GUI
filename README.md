# Python-Voice-Recorder-with-GUI
A Python-based Voice Recorder with a user-friendly GUI built using tkinter. This application allows users to record audio, visualize it in real-time with waveform display, save recordings as .wav files, and play them back. Features include a recording timer, real-time waveform visualization using matplotlib, and basic audio controls.
Python Voice Recorder with GUI üéôÔ∏è
Overview
This is a desktop voice recorder application built with Python. It uses tkinter for the graphical interface, sounddevice and scipy for audio recording and playback, and matplotlib for real-time waveform visualization. This project demonstrates audio processing, real-time feedback, and basic GUI development in Python.

Features
Audio Recording: Record audio in high-quality .wav format.
Waveform Visualization: See real-time waveform display during recording.
Playback and Save: Playback recorded audio, and save it to your system.
Recording Timer: Track the duration of the recording in real-time.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language.
tkinter: For building the GUI.
sounddevice: For audio recording.
scipy: For saving .wav files.
matplotlib: For real-time waveform visualization.
How to Use
Record: Click "Record" to start recording audio.
Stop: Click "Stop" to finish recording.
Play: Click "Play" to listen to your recording.
